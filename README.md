# 100 Days of Code
This is a challenge that involves ensuring that you are spending at least 1 hour a day learning / working on code. This helps develop your commitment to be a better programmer by ensuring that you are always learning.

## Day 1
I spent today learning about bootstrap in CSS and implementing it into a basic webpage. This mainly involved learning about what bootstrap is and playing around with how to edit wthe default bootstrap content with my own personal touch. I also created a very basic website with Mailchimp (also including some bootstrap for practice), just to give myself some experince of using something like that, and put it on the internet to be able to be accessed by anyone online (not linked in GitHub as it was just used for testing a lot of new things).

## Day 2
Today was all about layouts! Spent some time learning and playing around with CSS grids, as well as how to integrate the use of them with flexbox. Learning how to create beautiful websites with this tool was very insightful. I also messed around a bit with some transformations on elements on their hover action. This led to some really interesting animations that I can't wait to implement into websites in the future. No real tangible progress again today as it was more about getting accustomed to the useful tools of CSS that will be used to help me with future projects. 

## Day 3
Javascript, Javascript and more Javascript! Today was spent learning the fundamentals of the language - not too much to write home about as it works in a similar way to a lot of other languages that I already know, so it was basically just about learning the syntax (which was also not complex, but you need to know the basics before you can really do anything impressive, so a necessary day in the grand scheme of things). All of the most common aspects of the language were covered, such as the possible types, the comparisons that you can make, how to create variables, how to control the flow of the code with conditional statements and logical operators, and also learning how to create functions and return values.

## Day 4
Got in some more Javascript today - had to finish covering the basics by looking over data structures in this new language. This included some arrays and how to create and call them, as well as objects (what they are and how to instantiate) among other things. Was also just a lot of "revision" of concepts I already knew in a knew language. Again a bit of a boring day, but can't wait to see what exciting challenges come in the next day of coding!

## Day 5
Finally moved on from syntax! Learnt about DOM manipulation today which was super interesting - all that syntax learning finally paying off! Focused on the different types of selectors and events that you can have, and how to put those events into action. It creates really responsive websites and allows you to expand the capabailities of your basic website - such power behind so few lines of code. All in all, a very interesting and educational day - excited to dive deeper into this topic.

## Day 6
A great day of putting what I've learnt so far into action. Today I created a [background generator](https://github.com/taylarogers/background-generator) which uses all of my knowledge in CSS, HTML and Javascript  - it was challenging for sure, but lovely to be able to create something with all of the knowledge that I have gained. The more you code, the better you get! So I just have to keep coding and creating new things and I'm sure I will get the hang of it in no time. Also looked up a bit on jQuery for interest's sake - was very intricate and I see why new technologies were created to make the process easier. Hoping to try out some more code tomorrow!

## Day 7
A day full of battle with Javscript. Decided to put in some more practice with my new Javascript knowledge and create a [to-do list](https://github.com/taylarogers/todo-list) that allows you to check items off the list, delete items and add new ones. This involved looking into some new Javascript features that I hadn't explored before. It took me a long time of fighting with my code, but I got everything working how I wanted it to and I feel like I have learnt a lot in the process. Happy to have made some more progress in mastering this new language.

## Day 8
Today I carried on with some more work on my to-do list. I thought I would take the opportunity to practice my CSS as well and try to create something that I was proud of. I still have a lot to learn in terms of design, but the only way to get better is to practice more! Not completely happy with how it turned out, but hopefully I can come back to this once I have further developed my skills and see where I can make fixes.

## Day 9
I took the time today to look into some more advanced concepts of Javascript. Such as a lot of the new formatting available for use in new versions of ECMAScript. Nothing really to show for the day as I was just looking into things that will be integral in my further learning of the language. Excited to dive deeper into this concept.

## Day 10
Furthering my knowledge of the complicated aspects of Javascript was the goal for today. I focused mainly on learning some advanced features and new ways to do arrays, objects and functions. What I found most particularly interesting was the concept of a "curried" function - I struggled to see the purpose of it at first, but after playing around with it a bit more I have now come to realise how useful it can be in certain circumstances. Keen to move onto some more interesting topics tomorrow.

## Day 11
Today I did some revision on pass by value vs pass by reference. I have heard this so many times in my studies at this point, yet still just one of those things that I will always need to double check as I constantly confuse the two for each other. I also looked at some advanced loop features and some more new ECMAScript functionality and syntax. 

## Day 12
Lots and lots of practice coding was the tone for the day. I did a lot of exercises to solidify the new ECMAScript concepts that I have been learning about. It's all about getting accustomed to the new syntax and methods which would make coding easier. I feel a lot more confident in my knowledge about these concepts now. I also learnt about creating modules in Javascript and the benefits that using modules can bring to your coding. Looking forward to one more day of Javascript tomorrow.

## Day 13
Today was filled with lots of important knowledge about how Javascript works. The understanding of Javascript as a "single-threaded language that can be non-blocking" was an important concept into today's investigations, and it was very interesting to learn about the connection and interactions between the callback queue and event loop that are used in the Javascript run-time environment to achieve this.

## Day 14
A day in review... literally. I took today to review a lot of important command line concepts - my skills have been a bit rusty and I keep having to google things that I have previously learnt, so just decided to take the day to refresh my brain and get back in the swing of using the terminal instead of the Github desktop application. I also looked into some new git commands to deal with branching and how to deal with forks, that I previously didn't know.

## Day 15
Today I contributed to my first open source project! Nothing too serious or life-changing, you simply had to create a component that would be displayed on a website for people to access (of which I created a flipcard that flips when clicked), but it allowed me to learn about how you would work in a team and to get some practice in so that the concepts do not feel so foreign. It was a bit confusing looking at it from the outside, but once I actually sat down and contributed I felt like I understood how it worked. Overall a very valuable lesson.

## Day 16
NPM is such a valuable resource and I am so glad that I spent the day learning all about it. Today I just looked into what NPM was and how it is beneficial. I also started messing around with installing some of the packages that NPM offers. It was very interesting to learn how this all works and I know all the packages will come in very handy in upcoming projects.

## Day 17
Today I did some coding challenges on Hacker Earth. I wanted to refresh my Java knowledge a bit so I'm trying to do a couple challenges to make sure my brain isn't completely forgetting the language. Nothing to report on - I think I got through 3 today which I am happy with.

## Day 18
I did some more coding challenges on Hacker Earth today. I feel like I am starting to get back into the swing of thngs with Java - it's difficult sometimes to switch between langauges and not get confused so I think it is always important to go back and do some revision every now and then so that your brain doesn't get too clouded.
