# 100 Days of Code
This is a challenge that involves ensuring that you are spending at least 1 hour a day learning / working on code. This helps develop your commitment to be a better programmer by ensuring that you are always learning.

## Day 1
I spent today learning about bootstrap in CSS and implementing it into a basic webpage. This mainly involved learning about what bootstrap is and playing around with how to edit wthe default bootstrap content with my own personal touch. I also created a very basic website with Mailchimp (also including some bootstrap for practice), just to give myself some experince of using something like that, and put it on the internet to be able to be accessed by anyone online (not linked in GitHub as it was just used for testing a lot of new things).

## Day 2
Today was all about layouts! Spent some time learning and playing around with CSS grids, as well as how to integrate the use of them with flexbox. Learning how to create beautiful websites with this tool was very insightful. I also messed around a bit with some transformations on elements on their hover action. This led to some really interesting animations that I can't wait to implement into websites in the future. No real tangible progress again today as it was more about getting accustomed to the useful tools of CSS that will be used to help me with future projects. 

## Day 3
Javascript, Javascript and more Javascript! Today was spent learning the fundamentals of the language - not too much to write home about as it works in a similar way to a lot of other languages that I already know, so it was basically just about learning the syntax (which was also not complex, but you need to know the basics before you can really do anything impressive, so a necessary day in the grand scheme of things). All of the most common aspects of the language were covered, such as the possible types, the comparisons that you can make, how to create variables, how to control the flow of the code with conditional statements and logical operators, and also learning how to create functions and return values.

## Day 4
Got in some more Javascript today - had to finish covering the basics by looking over data structures in this new language. This included some arrays and how to create and call them, as well as objects (what they are and how to instantiate) among other things. Was also just a lot of "revision" of concepts I already knew in a knew language. Again a bit of a boring day, but can't wait to see what exciting challenges come in the next day of coding!

## Day 5
Finally moved on from syntax! Learnt about DOM manipulation today which was super interesting - all that syntax learning finally paying off! Focused on the different types of selectors and events that you can have, and how to put those events into action. It creates really responsive websites and allows you to expand the capabailities of your basic website - such power behind so few lines of code. All in all, a very interesting and educational day - excited to dive deeper into this topic.

## Day 6
A great day of putting what I've learnt so far into action. Today I created a background generator which uses all of my knowledge in CSS, HTML and Javascript (https://github.com/taylarogers/background-generator) - it was challenging for sure, but lovely to be able to create something with all of the knowledge that I have gained. The more you code, the better you get! So I just have to keep coding and creating new things and I'm sure I will get the hang of it in no time. Also looked up a bit on jQuery for interest's sake - was very intricate and I see why new technologies were created to make the process easier. Hoping to try out some more code tomorrow!

## Day 7
A day full of battle with Javscript. Decided to put in some more practice with my new Javascript knowledge and create a to-do list that allows you to check items off the list, delete items and add new ones. This involved looking into some new Javascript features that I hadn't explored before. It took me a long time of fighting with my code, but I got everything working how I wanted it to and I feel like I have learnt a lot in the process. Happy to have made some more progress in mastering this new language.
