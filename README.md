# 100 Days of Code
This is a challenge that involves ensuring that you are spending at least 1 hour a day learning / working on code. This helps develop your commitment to be a better programmer by ensuring that you are always learning.

## Day 1
I spent today learning about bootstrap in CSS and implementing it into a basic webpage. This mainly involved learning about what bootstrap is and playing around with how to edit wthe default bootstrap content with my own personal touch. I also created a very basic website with Mailchimp (also including some bootstrap for practice), just to give myself some experince of using something like that, and put it on the internet to be able to be accessed by anyone online (not linked in GitHub as it was just used for testing a lot of new things).

## Day 2
Today was all about layouts! Spent some time learning and playing around with CSS grids, as well as how to integrate the use of them with flexbox. Learning how to create beautiful websites with this tool was very insightful. I also messed around a bit with some transformations on elements on their hover action. This led to some really interesting animations that I can't wait to implement into websites in the future. No real tangible progress again today as it was more about getting accustomed to the useful tools of CSS that will be used to help me with future projects.
