# 100 Days of Code
This is a challenge that involves ensuring that you are spending at least 1 hour a day learning / working on code. This helps develop your commitment to be a better programmer by ensuring that you are always learning.

## Day 1
I spent today learning about bootstrap in CSS and implementing it into a basic webpage. This mainly involved learning about what bootstrap is and playing around with how to edit wthe default bootstrap content with my own personal touch. I also created a very basic website with Mailchimp (also including some bootstrap for practice), just to give myself some experince of using something like that, and put it on the internet to be able to be accessed by anyone online (not linked in GitHub as it was just used for testing a lot of new things).
